This repository demonstrates a subtle type inference issue in Scala when using parameterized classes with List types. The code compiles and runs without issues for simple types such as Int and String. However, when a List is passed as the type parameter, it throws a runtime exception. The solution involves explicitly specifying the type parameter of MyClass during object instantiation to resolve the type inference ambiguity.
